Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It is a field of engineering that focuses on creating things that can't be touched physically.


What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

It defers from traditional programming in the way it is structured.

It is structured in several phases as follows:

1) Requirement
2) Design
3) Implementation
4) Testing
5) Deployment
6) Maintenance

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Provide a brief description of each phase.

1) Requirement: It involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

2) Design: It involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.

3) Implementation: It involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.

4) Testing: It involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.

5) Deployment: It involves releasing the software to users or customers.

6) Maintenance: It involves providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

These are methodology models.

Agile Model: It involves an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.

Waterfall Model: It involves the sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfall. 


Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

The Agile Model of software development has an iterative and incremental approach while the Waterfall model of software development has a sequential approach.

The Agile Model of software development is focused on flexibility, and collaboration while the Waterfall model of software development is not.

The Agile Model of software development is good for short-term projects while the Waterfall Model of software development is good for long-term projects.


Requirements Engineering:

It is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

The Process of Requirements engineering is as follows:

1) Feasibility Study: This refers to the planning of the technical, operational, and economic resources of software development. It is important because it makes a proper plan for every resources that is needed before starting a project just as in the first and second stages of SDLC.

2) Requirements elicitation: This is used to gain knowledge about the project domain and requirements; and to gather information about the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is important because it makes it user-centric just as the fifth stage in SDLC.

3) Requirements specification: It is the process of documenting the requirements identified in the analysis step in a clear, consistent, and unambiguous manner. It is important because it is needed in the fifth stage of SDLC.

4) Requirements for verification and validation:

a) Verification: It refers to the set of tasks that ensures that the software correctly implements a specific function.

b) Validation: It refers to a different set of tasks that ensures that the software that has been built is traceable to customer requirements. It is important because it is needed in the fifth  and Sixth stages of SDLC.

5) Requirements management: It is the process of analyzing, documenting, tracking, prioritizing, and agreeing on the requirement and controlling the communication with relevant stakeholders. It is important because it is needed in the fifth and sixth stages of SDLC.

Software Design Principles:

These include:

1) Should not suffer from "Tunnel Vision"

2) Traceable to analysis

3) Should not "Reinvent the wheel"

4) Minimize intellectual distance

5) Exhibit uniformity and integration

6) Accommodate change

7) Degrade gently

8) Assessed or quality

9) Review to discover errors

10) Design is not coding and coding is not design

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve the maintainability and scalability of software systems?

The concept of modularity in software design is breaking down a large software system into smaller modules, to enable developers to focus on writing code that is easier to understand, test and maintain, and thereby improving maintainability and scalability of software system.

Citation: https://www.institutedata.com/us/blog/modularity-in-software-engineering/

Testing in Software Engineering:

It involves verifying and validating that a software application is free of bugs, meets the technical requirements that is set by its design and development, and satisfies user requirements efficiently and effectively.

Citation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-basics/


Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

1) Unit testing: It refers to the testing of individual units/components of a software/system.

2) Integration testing: It refers to combining and testing individual units. 

3) System testing: It refers to testing a complete, integrated software or system.

4) Acceptance testing: It refers to testing a system for acceptability.

Citation: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing-basics/


Version Control Systems:

A version control system (VCS) tracks every alteration to a file or set of files, enabling developers to journey back to earlier versions and collaborate seamlessly.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are systems that tracks every alteration to a file or set of files, enabling developers to journey back to earlier versions and collaborate seamlessly.

There are 2 types which include: 

a) Distributed: This allows users to access a repository from multiple locations.

b) Centralized: This allows users to work with the same central repository.

They are important in software development in that developers can track their progress and collaborate with other developers on a project.

Examples of popular version control systems and their features:

1) Github: Local branching, multiple workflows, and convenient staging areas.

2) Gitlab: Continuous integration, automatically test and deliver the code.

3) Beanstalk: leverages encryption, two-factor authentication, and password protection functionalities.

4) PerForce: support for both centralized and distributed development workflows.
